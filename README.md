# Daniel Ahl's Repository for Design of Compilers

**All code to be graded is found under the master branch**

The language I have chosen to write my compiler in is Typescript.

Typescript can be downloaded from https://www.typescriptlang.org/#download-links

It can be installed from Node.js using the command `npm install -g typescript`

After the Typescript compiler is installed, simply navigate to the root folder of this repository and run `tsc`. The generated javascript can be found in the bin folder and will be linked to in the HTML.
